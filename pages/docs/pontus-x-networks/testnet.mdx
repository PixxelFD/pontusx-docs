# Pontus-X Testnet

The Pontus-X Testnet is designed to be a robust testing environment for completed use cases fully developed and vetted on the Devnet. The Testnet provides a stable and reliable platform for final validation before projects are potentially deployed in real-world applications.

## Key Features and Components

### Network Configuration
- **Chain ID:** 32457
- **Block Explorer URL:** [Pontus-X Explorer Testnet](https://explorer.pontus-x.eu/testnet/pontusx)
- **Provider URL:** `https://provider.test.pontus-x.eu`
- **Aquarius URL:** `https://aquarius.pontus-x.eu`
- **Subgraph URL:** `https://subgraph.test.pontus-x.eu`

### Purpose and Usage
The Pontus-X Testnet is used for the following purposes:
- **Final Validation:** Projects fully developed and tested on the Devnet are moved to the Testnet for final validation. This ensures stability and reliability before they are considered for production environments.
- **Testing Finished Use Cases:** It runs finished use cases under conditions that closely resemble real-world scenarios, helping to identify any last-minute issues and ensuring the project's robustness.
- **Performance Testing:** Conduct performance tests to evaluate how well the applications handle high transaction volumes and stress conditions.
- **Security Testing:** Validate the security measures and identify potential vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

### Additional Tools and Services
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Integrate monitoring tools to monitor network performance and receive alerts in case of issues.
- **Logging and Analytics:** Implement logging and analytics to gain insights into network usage patterns, transaction statistics, and performance metrics.
- **Automated Testing:** Use automated testing tools to run continuous integration and deployment pipelines, ensuring code changes do not introduce new issues.

## Benefits of the Pontus-X Testnet
1. **Ensured Stability:** By providing a platform for project final validation, the Testnet ensures that only stable and reliable projects move forward.
2. **Risk Mitigation:** It helps identify and resolve issues in a controlled environment, reducing risks when deploying projects to production.
3. **Real-World Simulation:** The Testnet mimics real-world conditions, allowing for thorough testing and validation of use cases.
4. **Community Confidence:** Successful testing on the Testnet builds confidence among community members and stakeholders in the projects' reliability.
5. **Cost-Effective Testing:** Developers can test their applications without incurring the costs associated with mainnet transactions.
6. **Feedback Loop:** This loop provides an opportunity for community feedback and iterative improvement before deployment to production.

### Monitoring and Debugging
- **Block Explorer:** Use the [Pontus-X Explorer Testnet](https://explorer.pontus-x.eu/testnet/pontusx) to monitor transactions, blocks, and addresses.
- **Logging:** Enable detailed logging for your applications to capture transaction details, errors, and performance metrics.
