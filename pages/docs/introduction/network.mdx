# What is the Pontus-X Network?

The Pontus-X Network (also known as Pontus-X Testnet) is a community-driven Pan-European network and neutral decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) and software infrastructure for the Pontus-X ecosystem, a first fully decentralized data space in Gaia-X. It is owned by no one and open to everyone, entirely run and governed by Gaia-X community members dedicated to the Gaia-X Association for Data and Cloud (AISBL) Trust Framework.

The Pontus-X network is a customizable blockchain built using the Oasis Protocol leveraging Oasis ParaTimes. The expanding software stack enables the creation of industry-specific data spaces and ecosystems that can be tailored to individual needs and use cases of consortia, SMEs, or public institutions. Other networks and software stacks follow to expand the capabilities and address ecosystem specific needs.

By providing a neutral, open, decentralized and secure infrastructure for digital transactions, the network enables businesses and institutions to have more control over their data and how it is used, while also ensuring compliance with the Gaia-X Trust Framework. This helps to foster trust and interoperability within the Pontus-X and Gaia-X ecosystem and allows for data spaces that can be used by multiple parties in a decentralized and autonomous manner without creating further data silos.
