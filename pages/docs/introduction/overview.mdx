# Overview

Pontus-X is a decentralized digital ecosystem. It enables companies and institutions to consume, offer and monetize data, software and infrastructure services within a trusted and transparent environment. Pontus-X is built on Gaia-X principles and Ocean Enterprise technology, emphasizing decentralization and data sovereignty.

The Pontus-X ecosystem provides a domain-agnostic solution in sectors including but not limited to aerospace, manufacturing, industry 4.0, mobility, AI and data-driven businesses, and open science.

**Pontus-X is not just a data sharing solution. It is a whole ecosystem uniting various custom data spaces across industries.**

| **Component** | **Description** |
|------|-------------|
| <img src="/images/spaces-icon.png" alt="Spaces (data marketplaces)" width="50"/> **Spaces (data marketplaces)** | There are several companies and institutions providing a digital marketplace, a user-interface where participants can search, discover, consume, and offer digital services (data, software, and cloud services). Each space can be connected to Pontus-X, so the services offered in one space are cross-referenced. Operators of spaces can, but must not, act as an operator. |
| <img src="/images/operators-icon.png" alt="Operators" width="50"/> **Operators** | Pontus-X Operators are current members and representatives of the Pontus-X community. They provide the required infrastructure and services and validate transactions. |
| <img src="/images/providers-icon.png" alt="Providers" width="50"/> **Providers** | Technology, standards, protocol, or service providers represent another crucial part of Pontus-X and its functionalities, like payment (EUROe), network solutions (Oasis), protocols (Ocean Enterprise) and standards (Gaia-X). |

## Why do we care?
The European data economy is expected to grow from 301 billion in 2018 to 829 billion in 2025. Data sharing and thus the effective development of AI solutions is vital for European companies and their competitiveness in the global market. Nevertheless, there are many reasons why data sharing continues to be carried out only on a small scale and with little sensitive data. Companies are concerned about losing control over their data and thus their intellectual property. Furthermore, there are high penalties for GDPR-violations. Companies do not trust data platforms that they do not control and whose participants they do not know.

The Pontus-X ecosystem for Gaia-X and Compute-to-Data contributes to solve these problems and bring trust to data ecosystems and data spaces with its neutral and federated network, which has no controlling central authority and by following the rules of the Gaia-X Trust Framework.

## What are my benefits?
The Pontus-X ecosystem enables monetization of services and usage of sensitive data without losing control over it. This opens a whole new range of revenue opportunities. It is irrelevant where the data is located, any source up to edge devices can be connected to the data space. An open, transparent and ecosystem in the Gaia-X network opens a significantly larger amount of data and thus many new use cases and AI solutions in many different verticals. It creates the conditions for an outburst of digital services and data-driven use cases within the European market.
