# What is the Pontus-X ecosystem for Gaia-X?

The Pontus-X ecosystem is the first Pan-European, fully decentralized digital service ecosystem in Gaia-X, enabling technical data-sovereign data sharing and digital service monetization, while adhering to the rules of the Gaia-X Trust Framework.

It allows companies and institutions to consume and offer AI, software, data and infrastructure services in the Pontus-X ecosystem, while remaining in control of their IP and sensitive data, thus meeting GDPR and IT-security requirements. A place to publish, discover, select, and consume digital service offerings are our portals, which provide a user-interface to interact with the federation services and other ecosystem services. Besides the portals all services can also be managed and consumed programmatically through libraries such as Nautilus.

Within Pontus-X, you can utilize federated analysis, machine learning (ML) algorithms and AI (Artificial Intelligence) services to extract valuable information from data services or to offer access to your sensitive data without the risk of exposing it to unnecessary third-party or compliance risks. One of the core features of the Pontus-X ecosystem for Gaia-X is a data access and orchestration mechanism called Compute-to-Data (CtD). CtD enables data owners to grant only compute access to their data without the need to create copies in other environments you do not control. The data itself can remain with the data owner in a secured environment to minimize the risk of data-leaks. The underlying software components enable you to control your exposure to third-party services in a granular manner within the full cloud-to-edge continuum. Pontus-X goes beyond the federation services by natively supporting settlement of business cases through EU-regulated e-money EUROe and supporting sustainable business operations for all participants providing infrastructure and services.

The Pontus-X ecosystem for Gaia-X has been deployed and officially launched by deltaDAO in 2021 during the very first Gaia-X Hackathon event and and has been continuously developed, evolved and grown since then.

Today Pontus-X features the full set of federation services, added ecosystem services from various providers, and is connected to the Gaia-X Digital Clearing Houses (GXDCH) and the Gaia-X Compliance Service and Gaia-X Registry. It features hundreds of service offerings from all over Europe and across the Gaia-X domains while enabling the community to rapidly develop digital services for an open ecosystem.

This Pontus-X ecosystem allows all participants to become a federator without relying on any centralized component and central point of failure and control in its stack. All participants can contribute and share the common infrastructure while any participant or federator can stop participating at any point in time, without stopping or interrupting the function of the ecosystem. This also supports the full range of business models for all participants in the ecosystem which is crucial for sustainability.

The federated ecosystem services of Pontus-X are supported by a wide range of applications and open-source software, i.e. in the form of smart contracts. Pontus-X utilizes free open-source software from the Ocean Protocol software stack to support data exchange services, catalogue services, contracting services and orchestration of software, infrastructure and data services.
