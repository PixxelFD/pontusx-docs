# W3C Verifiable Credentials and Verifiable Presentations

[W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) and Presentations provide a standardized way to express and verify digital credentials on the web. Here are some benefits:

1. Trust and Verification: They allow any verifier to check the authenticity of the credentials without needing to contact the issuer directly. This is done through cryptographic proofs.

2. Interoperability: As a W3C standard, they ensure interoperability across different systems and platforms.

3. Flexibility: They can be used to present all types of qualifications and certifications alongside the Ocean Enterprise Service Credential. This ensures data ecosystem interoperability.

4. Security: The use of JOSE (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) for securing credentials and presentations provides robust security against tampering and forgery.

Verifiable presentations and credentials are secured using [`JOSE`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-jose-cose/). See [Securing JSON-LD Verifiable Presentations with JOSE](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-jose-cose/#securing-vps-with-jose)

This means that the credentials are signed and encoded in JWT format. The JWT format is a widely used standard for encoding JSON data in a compact and secure way.

To sign the credentials and presentations, the issuer uses a blockchain account private key to create a digital signature. The verifier can then use the issuer's public key to verify the signature.
