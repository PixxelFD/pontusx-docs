# ODRL Object

The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about the usage of content and services.

The Ocean Enterprise technology stack enables the definition of ODRL policies, although it does not provide the technical means to enforce them. Access control is implemented through the `credentials` object.
