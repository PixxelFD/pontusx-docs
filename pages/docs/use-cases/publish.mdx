# Publishing with Nautilus

In the decentralized data economy of Pontus-X, publishing data, applications, and services is essential for enabling a thriving ecosystem. By making your assets available, you contribute to the collective value and utility of the network. This chapter guides you through the process of publishing assets using the Nautilus interface, simplifying the creation and configuration of assets.

## Introduction to Publishing

Publishing in Pontus-X involves describing your asset in a standardized way so that it can be displayed in catalogs, offered on marketplaces, and sold to others. Constructing a Decentralized Identifier Document (DDO) can be complex, but Nautilus streamlines this process with two main builder classes: `AssetBuilder` and `ServiceBuilder`.

## Creating Asset Metadata with AssetBuilder

The `AssetBuilder` class in Nautilus helps you construct the metadata for your asset. Follow these steps to set up and build your asset's metadata:

1. **Setup and Initialization:** Begin by creating an instance of `AssetBuilder`.

   ```javascript
   import { AssetBuilder } from '@deltadao/nautilus'

   const assetBuilder = new AssetBuilder()
   ```

2. **Configure Metadata:** Use the builder pattern to set up the metadata information for the asset, such as type, name, description, and author.

   ```javascript
   assetBuilder
     .setType('dataset')
     .setName('My New Asset')
     .setDescription('This is a publish asset building test using Nautilus')
     .setAuthor('Company Ltd.')
   ```

3. **Build the Asset:** Finalize the configuration by calling the `build()` method, which returns a correctly configured asset ready for publishing.

   ```javascript
   const asset = assetBuilder.build()
   ```

## Defining Services with ServiceBuilder

While the asset now has metadata, it needs defined services to be functional. The `ServiceBuilder` class allows you to specify how the asset can be accessed or interacted with.

1. **Setup ServiceBuilder:** Initialize `ServiceBuilder` with the appropriate service type and file type.

   ```javascript
   import { UrlFile, FileTypes, ServiceTypes, ServiceBuilder } from '@deltadao/nautilus'

   const serviceBuilder = new ServiceBuilder({
     serviceType: ServiceTypes.ACCESS,
     fileType: FileTypes.URL
   })
   ```

2. **Declare the File:** Define the file you want to publish. This example uses an HTTP GET request to access the asset.

   ```javascript
   const urlFile = {
     type: 'url',
     url: 'https://link.to/my/asset',
     method: 'GET'
   }
   ```

:::info
For quick testing, you can use any publicly available file on e.g. GitHub. Ensure that you have the rights to the file and that the endpoint is reliably reachable.

3. **Add Metadata and Build the Service:** Use the builder pattern to add required metadata and the file, then build the service.

   ```javascript
   const service = serviceBuilder
     .setServiceEndpoint('https://provider.dev.pontus-x.eu')
     .setTimeout(0)
     .addFile(urlFile)
     .setPricing({
       type: 'free'
     })
     .build()
   ```

:::info
You are currently publishing on the Pontus-X Devnet, as indicated by the provider url. This is ideal for testing. However, once you are satisfied with your use case, you should consider publishing it on the Pontus-X Testnet for final validation.

## Publishing the Asset

Combine the asset metadata and services, then publish the asset using the Nautilus interface.

1. **Add Service to Asset:** Add the configured service to your asset.

   ```javascript
   const assetWithService = assetBuilder.addService(service).build()
   ```

2. **Publish the Asset:** Use the `nautilus.publish` function to anchor the asset on your chosen network.

   ```javascript
   const result = await nautilus.publish(assetWithService)
   ```

## Example Code

Here's a complete example demonstrating the publishing process using Nautilus:

```javascript
import { Nautilus, AssetBuilder, ServiceBuilder, UrlFile, FileTypes, ServiceTypes } from '@deltadao/nautilus'
import { providers, Wallet } from 'ethers'

const provider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.dev.pontux-x.eu')
const signer = new Wallet('0x...', provider)

// Create the Nautilus instance
const nautilus = await Nautilus.create(signer)

// Setup AssetBuilder
const assetBuilder = new AssetBuilder()
  .setType('dataset')
  .setName('My New Asset')
  .setDescription('This is a publish asset building test using Nautilus')
  .setAuthor('Company Ltd.')

// Setup ServiceBuilder
const serviceBuilder = new ServiceBuilder({
  serviceType: ServiceTypes.ACCESS,
  fileType: FileTypes.URL
})

const urlFile = {
  type: 'url',
  url: 'https://link.to/my/asset',
  method: 'GET'
}

const service = serviceBuilder
  .setServiceEndpoint('https://provider.dev.pontus-x.eu')
  .setTimeout(0)
  .addFile(urlFile)
  .setPricing({
    type: 'free'
  })
  .build()

// Add service to asset and build
const assetWithService = assetBuilder.addService(service).build()

// Publish the asset
const result = await nautilus.publish(assetWithService)
```
