# Pontus-X Portals

The portals in Pontus-X provide users with the ability to browse the catalogue and search for specific service offerings. Furthermore, the portal offers straightforward capabilities for publishing, ordering and consumption of services. A portal can connect to multiple networks simultaneously and is designed to interoperate with other portals, as the underlying infrastructure (Pontus-X networks) is the same. 

It is possible to configure and customise portals so that only selected services are displayed. The Pontus-X reference portal can be accessed at https://www.pontus-x.eu/.
