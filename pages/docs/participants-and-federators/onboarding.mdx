# How to join Pontus-X as a validator?

If you are interested in joining our Pontus-X Testnet and contributing to the first federated Gaia-X ecosystem with community-driven governance,  you are welcome to contact us (contact@delta-dao.com) or any other partner from the network. As a prerequisite, you must commit to the Gaia-X Trust Framework and display W3C-compliant verifiable credentials for your identity and infrastructure. These Gaia-X compliant Self-Descriptions allow other participants of the Gaia-X Web3 ecosystem to decide if they trust you and your services.

If you want to learn more about Gaia-X compliance and the Gaia-X Trust Framework, you will find a great starting point [here](https://compliance.gaia-x.eu/). You can also read the basic technical requirements, including [step-by-step](https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/lab/compliance/gx-compliance) instructions on creating Gaia-X-compliant Self-Descriptions.

Furthermore, we can recommend the overview about the [Gaia-X Compliance Service](https://deltadao.medium.com/gaia-x-compliance-service-a3df1d6ffc52), which gives a detailed overview of Gaia-X's signing and validation services. When all conditions are met, any validator can initiate a vote to add a new member to the Pontus-X Testnet. The current validators then vote democratically on whether to accept the new participant.
